## Go Challenge #1
Project Information: http://golang-challenge.org/go-challenge1/

If you want to try this challenge yourself
* Directions: above [link](http://golang-challenge.org/go-challenge1/)
* Starter code: included `./starter_code/`
    * I created this from other projects, the original link appears to be broken

My solution attempt
* `./drum/`
    * `./decoder_test.go`
        * included test file
    * `decoder.go`
    * `drum.go`
* `./playground/`
    * `playground.go`
        * I first got the problem/solution running in this `.go`
    * `debug5.go`
        * [Spoiler Alert] `pattern_5` has an issue, I used this file to print relevant information to create a fix
